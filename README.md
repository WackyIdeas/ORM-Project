# ORM Project

## Build instructions

Run the scripts ```build_server.sh``` and ```build_client.sh``` in the ```src``` directory.

## Usage

To run the server and client, in the ```src``` directory simply run: 
```
$ ./server

$ ./client
```

Optionally, the client application takes an additional argument for the server IP address. If not set, the client will attempt to connect to a server at ```localhost```.
